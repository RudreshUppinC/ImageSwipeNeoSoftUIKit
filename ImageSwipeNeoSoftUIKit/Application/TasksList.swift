//• Images carousel: when user swipe left or right, list content
//should change accordingly. The images carousel can
//handle any number of images.


//• The list: when user scrolls up the whole page should scroll
//with it. The list can handle any number of items.
//P.S. images and list content can be local or loaded from
//the internet.


//• Search: Search bar should pin top when it reaches screen
//top. When user enter text, it should filter the labels in the
//list based on the user input.

//• Floating action button should show a nice bottom sheet
//dialog that contain a small statistic that consist of the
//count of items for each page and show the top 3
//occurrence character in the list. i.e
//listOf(“apple”, “banana” , “orange”, “blueberry”)
//List 1 (4 items)
//a = 5
//e = 4
//r = 3


//• Don’t use third party libraries


//• The code will be reviewed.


//• You’ve got 3.5 hours.


//• Implement the requirements using both SwiftUI & UIKit,
//each implementation should be pushed to a separate git
//branch.


//• Once done, push your code to GitHub and share the link
//with us.
